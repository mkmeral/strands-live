"""
AskAgent tool for Strands Agent delegation and specialized assistance.

This module provides functionality to communicate with powerful specialized agents
that have access to a comprehensive toolkit. When you don't know how to answer
a user's request or need specialized assistance, use this tool to delegate to
expert agents with different specializations.

Each agent specialty is configured with optimized system prompts and has access
to all available tools for comprehensive problem-solving capabilities.

Usage with Strands Agent:
```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import use_llm

agent = Agent(tools=[use_llm])

# Ask a coding specialist
result = agent.tool.use_llm(
    prompt="How do I implement a binary search tree in Python?",
    agent_specialty="coding"
)

# Ask a research specialist
result = agent.tool.use_llm(
    prompt="What are the latest developments in quantum computing?",
    agent_specialty="research"
)

# The response is available in the returned object
print(result["content"][0]["text"])  # Prints the response text
```

See the use_llm function docstring for more details on available specialties.

    Communicate with specialized agents that have comprehensive tool access.

    This function creates a specialized Strands Agent with optimized system prompts
    and full tool access. Use this whenever you need expert assistance or don't know
    how to handle a user's request. Each specialty provides focused expertise while
    maintaining access to all available tools for comprehensive problem-solving.

    How It Works:
    ------------
    1. Selects appropriate system prompt based on agent specialty
    2. Creates a new Agent instance with specialized configuration
    3. Processes the request in an isolated context with full tool access
    4. Returns detailed response with performance metrics
    5. Agent instance is cleaned up automatically after use

    Available Specialties:
    --------------------
    - coding: Expert software development, debugging, and architecture
    - research: Information gathering, analysis, and synthesis
    - writing: Content creation, editing, and communication
    - troubleshooting: Systematic problem diagnosis and resolution
    - analysis: Data examination, pattern recognition, and insights
    - general: Broad knowledge with effective tool utilization (default)

    When to Use:
    -----------
    - You don't know how to answer a user's request
    - You need specialized expertise in a particular domain
    - Complex problems requiring systematic tool usage
    - Tasks that benefit from focused, expert-level assistance

    Args:
        tool (ToolUse): Tool use object containing:
            - prompt (str): The request or question for the specialized agent
            - agent_specialty (str, optional): Agent type - defaults to "general"
        **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments

    Returns:
        ToolResult: Dictionary with status and response content:
        {
            "toolUseId": "unique-tool-use-id",
            "status": "success",
            "content": [
                {"text": "Response: [Agent's detailed response]"},
                {"text": "Metrics: [Performance and usage metrics]"}
            ]
        }

    Notes:
        - All agents have access to the complete toolkit for maximum capability
        - Responses include both the answer and performance metrics
        - Agent instances are temporary and isolated from parent context
        - Use this tool liberally when uncertain - it's designed for delegation
